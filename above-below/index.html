			How is looking<br> at the Earth<br> from above <br>a fantasy?
		</h1>
		<p>
			In the most obvious sense, it is a fantasy in the sense that it is unachieveable. At least for the everyday person, we still don't have common access to aircraft able to take us to such heights. However, it is also a fantasy in the sense that it is a dream that we aspire to. For most of human existence we have fantasized, in a pictorial and spoken manner, what the planet we reside on looks like. 
			<div id="realm">We placed our gods in a realm far above our own because that was deemed a space impossible to enter.</div> 
			<div id="float">So now that a select few have floated in space with a total view of planet Earth, what is the next fantasy?</div>

		<b>	Earth from above has a sense of fantasy due to its unthinkable reach. As you said it's something that is unachieveable to the every day person. The idea of placing <span id="gods">gods</span> in a realm far above our own is something I did not think about. It further psuehs the idea of "fantasies". Who knows, maybe the next fantast might be unlocking a new dimension? </b>

			<li>i feel like its really hard to seperate tech from spectatorship and navigation.</li>
			<li>iphones are all about spectatorship</li>
			<li>cars are all about navigation</li>
			<li> computers can be used to create, which is less related <br>but still somewhat related to spectatoship if you intend <br>to show people and share what you've made</li>
